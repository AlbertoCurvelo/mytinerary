* Create an account in [MongoDB](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register) or use one that you have, and obtain the code of the application of the closter, which we are going to save in a variable called "MONGOURL" in our .env.
* PORT, within the local job use 4000.
* HOST, you can use localhost or 127.0.0.1.
